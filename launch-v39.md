# BLACKOUT v3.9–v3.12: final ordered launch runbook

Source only. Nothing in this repository has been deployed, broadcast, bought, signed or minted, and this runbook
authorizes none of it: every paid step below is a separate, requester-approved IMD job. It supersedes
`launch-v38.md`, `launch-v37.md` and older runbooks where they differ.

**v3.12 (job c36ea654).** This version applies the corrections from research job 4e478378: named
`$contract:Params` / `$contract:GameRegistry` references in M4, the ProjectFactory registry
`0xf52b…8406` for proofs, the M3 request fields, objective texts with one common paragraph, a pointer to
[docs/m2-trust-assumption.md](docs/m2-trust-assumption.md) in M1 and M4, and realistic timing (§2a).
Every objective now names the **accepted BLACKOUT v3.12 commit**. No contract changed. The launch pins are
the same as v3.9–v3.11 (see `report.md` §v3.12). The research report itself was not in this workspace, so the
objective texts below were written from the corrections the brief lists. Compare them with research 4e478378
before pasting. **`foundry.toml` was not changed in v3.12** (the platform protects it in this job type): it
still says `via_ir = true` with no `bytecode_hash`, so the IMD launch build still needs the overrides in §0
until the requester has the profile changed (open item in `report.md`).

The game chain is **Robinhood Chain (4663)**, called "mainnet" below. The oracle schedules are bought on
**Ethereum (1)**. The rehearsal (v3.11) runs the same sequence on a **local anvil fork of 4663** against the real
platform contracts, impersonating the platform deployer; nothing is broadcast.

## 0. Rules for every step

- **One toolchain.** Every contract is deployed from the IMD verifier build of the accepted commit:
  solc 0.8.26, optimizer 200, cancun, `FOUNDRY_VIA_IR=false FOUNDRY_BYTECODE_HASH=none` (the `out-launch/`
  artifacts). The hook embeds `type(GameRegistry).creationCode` from its own build, so a registry or Params
  built with the repository's via-IR toolchain binds to the Desk but **never** to the hook (review L-1). Before
  each paid step, check the job's attested creation-code hash against `src/lib/SwarmCode.sol`
  (`REGISTRY_LAUNCH`, `PARAMS_LAUNCH`) and `ModuleCode.launchHash(role)`.
- **Keep the game configuration private until `Desk.bind`.** `starterRoot`, `freeRoot`, `snapshotBlock` and the
  eligibility lists stay unpublished until step M7 has passed its check. Anyone who knows them and the token can
  launch a twin registry through the factory and bind the Desk first (review M-2). Publish the free-pack lists
  and proofs only after M7.
- **Stop on any failed check.** Every step has an on-chain check. If it fails, do not run the next paid step.
  In particular, never call `EndowmentEscrow.forward` unless `Desk.registry()` is the job A registry.
- No value below is a guess. `<NAME>` marks a value recorded from an earlier step (from
  `GET /launches/:id`) or supplied by the requester.

| Rehearsal game configuration | Rehearsal operator | throw-away test roots, snapshot and attester key (never the production ones, so M-2 stays closed) |

## 2. Fork rehearsal (local anvil fork of 4663) — run in v3.11, passed

`tools/rehearse_v311.sh <4663 rpc>` starts `anvil --fork-url`, builds with the IMD launch toolchain and runs
`test/fork/RehearsalV311.t.sol` against the fork. The test executes M1–M13 in order through the **real**
ProjectFactory `0x9c9d…265e`, its registry `0xf52b…8406`, LaunchFactory `0xa25b…4645` and PoolManager
`0x8366…0951`, impersonating the platform deployer where the platform deploys or initializes, with the real
Intake/IntakeDelivery/IMD addresses in the Desk's oracle config, a test attester key, throw-away roots and
throw-away launch numbers 777001–777005 (asserted unrecorded first). Nothing is broadcast. The committed log is
`artifacts/v311/rehearsal.log` (every address, call and check); the result is summarised in `report.md`.

What the fork proved (2026-10-12, fork block 86865884, basefee 0.0206 gwei; see the log for the exact figures):

1. **Creation-code hashes.** Every contract the real factory deployed from the launch-toolchain build hashes to
   the pins: `SwarmCode.REGISTRY_LAUNCH`, `SwarmCode.PARAMS_LAUNCH`, `ModuleCode.launchHash(0..13)`. The
   CREATE2 addresses equal `predictContract`, so `register`, `bind`, `bindFeeRouter` and `forward` all pass
   their proofs. The attestation hashes the plane records must equal these same values.
2. **`afterInitialize` sender = LaunchFactory.** The trace shows `PoolManager.initialize` called by the
   LaunchFactory inside its launch transaction and `V4Market.afterInitialize(sender = 0xa25b…4645, …)`;
   `initializedAt()` is set. The `$factory` constructor word is correct.
3. **Gas per launch vs the 0.01 ETH ceiling** (gas used by the factory call, cost at the fork basefee):
   Desk 5,415,993; Escrow 1,743,701; token + hook 7,220,053; job A (8 contracts) 21,411,808; job B (8 contracts)
   19,523,888. At the fork basefee the dearest launch costs about 0.00045 ETH; the largest launch fits under the
   ceiling up to a basefee of about 0.47 gwei, more than 20× the fork's basefee.
4. **Constructor encoding through the real launcher.** The twelve-word SwarmDesk encoding
   (`tools/swarm_constructor_args.mjs` / `SwarmArgs.encode`), the three-word escrow, the eight-word hook with
   `$poolManager`, `$token`, `$factory` and the job A/B words all decoded as intended (every check view agrees).
5. **Order and checks.** `Desk.bind` → `register` 0–5 → job B + `register` 6–13 → `bindFeeRouter` → `forward`
   (full balance to the authenticated RewardPool) → `fundEndowment` (drip starts, 42 days) → relayed `submit`
   of an attested answer (plan severity clamped into 5000–7000) → keeper `advanceEpoch` with entropy reveal →
   `LaunchFactory.claimFees` pays the paying wallet (0.0198 ETH on a 2 ETH buy ≈ 1%). Buys at +5/+15/+25 min
   paid 90/50/25% to rewards; at +31 min exactly 1%; a net sell carried the surcharge; the first pack bought at
   +1h and its entropy was captured; before +1h `openPack` reverts `TooEarly`.

Where reality differed from the v3.10 runbook (all folded into §3 below, no contract change):

- **Pair currency.** The LaunchFactory `launch` tuple carries the pair currency explicitly. The three recorded
  4663 hook launches (1015, 1300, 1316) were all **IMD-paired**; BLACKOUT's `pairWith eth` must put the zero
  address there, so the pool is `(ETH, token)` as `V4Market.key()` expects. With IMD the hook's `afterInitialize`
  reverts `Unauthorized` on the key check and the launch fails (observed on the fork before the fix).
- **remainderTo gets the 20% plus the liquidity dust.** The factory sends `remainderTo` everything the pool
  position did not consume, so the escrow holds ≥ 200,000,000e18 (the fork: +560,364 tokens from the
  rehearsal's own liquidity figure). `forward` moves the whole balance; `fundEndowment` needs ≥ principal. OK.
- **First `advanceEpoch` before packs open.** Pack sales record into the live epoch, so the keeper's first
  `advanceEpoch` (allowed from pool initialization on) must land before +1h or `openPack` reverts `TooEarly`.

## 2a. Timing (budget before starting)

| Step | Kind | Budget | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 SwarmDesk | paid, 1 contract | ~63 min (median) | 1-contract launch jobs, research 4e478378 |
| M2 EndowmentEscrow | paid, 1 contract (needs `<DESK>`) | ~63 min (median) | same |
| M3 token + hook | paid, `univ4_hook` | not measured: budget 2 h | no median in the research |
| M4 job A | paid, 8 contracts | **unknown: budget 2 h** | no 8-contract median exists |
| M5 `Desk.bind` | permissionless | minutes, **immediately** after M4 is recorded | keeper `bind-desk` |
| M6 register 0–5 | permissionless | minutes | keeper |
| M7 job B | paid, 8 contracts | **unknown: budget 2 h** | as M4 |
| M8–M10 | permissionless | minutes | keeper |
| M11 schedules (Ethereum) | paid | queue time not measured | runs start at the next cron slot |

The paid steps are sequential (each needs the previous step's address), so the critical path is about
**7–9 hours** from M1 to M10. Consequences that follow from the code:

- **Launch tax and fees before the game exists.** The 30-minute stepped launch tax starts at M3 pool
  initialization and is over long before job A lands. Swap fees from M3 until M8 accumulate in the hook
  (`heldBase`); `flushFees` reverts `NotConfigured` until `bindFeeRouter`, and then forwards them all.
- **The pack gate has passed by then.** Packs may open from M3 + 1 h, but `PackSale` only exists after M4, and
  pack sales record into the live epoch. The keeper's first `FarmRewards.advanceEpoch()` is therefore its first
  action after M10, before the site announces packs. Earlier pack calls revert `TooEarly` and move nothing.
- **M-2 window.** The roots become public when M4 executes. M5 must follow at once
  ([docs/m2-trust-assumption.md](docs/m2-trust-assumption.md)).

## 3. Mainnet (Robinhood Chain 4663), in order

### Common paragraph (append verbatim to the M1, M2, M4 and M7 objectives)

> Source: the accepted BLACKOUT v3.12 commit of identity-md-launches/launch-1269-reports-v1-job-b9e37680-814c-4f17-b4bc-6. Build exactly with solc 0.8.26, optimizer true, 200 runs, evm cancun, viaIR false, bytecode_hash none, and deploy the creation code as built. The contracts authenticate each other by creation-code hash (src/lib/SwarmCode.sol, ModuleCode.launchHash), so another build cannot be wired. Chain: Robinhood Chain (4663). Platform proofs use the ProjectFactory 0x9c9d2fcb75c2c132c0ac0c42df3819a42347265e (predictContract) and its launch registry 0xf52bbe066b7ad2d28c2195d066ea08dcbca88406 (isRecorded). No owner, admin key, upgrade, withdrawal, token action, mint or placeholder: every constructor value is listed above. Known trust assumption: docs/m2-trust-assumption.md (twin front-run of SwarmDesk.bind, griefing only, mitigated by binding right after job A). Project: https://playblackout.xyz · https://x.com/IMDBlackout

Each paid step lists its objective text (paste verbatim after filling the `<...>` values; each is well under
8000 characters), its inputs and the check that proves it worked. Permissionless calls (M7 onward) can be
sent by any wallet; the keeper sends them with `node keeper/keeper.mjs wire --wiring wiring.json` (template
`keeper/wiring.example.json`), dry run first.

### M1. SwarmDesk bootstrap (paid, `launch.open`, `onchain: "evm_contracts"`, 1 contract)

Inputs: `GAME_CONFIG_HASH`; `docs/oracle-v37/oracle-config.json`; binding file
`{"factory":"0x9c9d2fcb75c2c132c0ac0c42df3819a42347265e","registryLaunch":"0","registryIndex":0,"paramsLaunch":"0","paramsIndex":0,"heartbeatBps":200,"heartbeatCap":"1000000000000000000","gameConfigHash":"<GAME_CONFIG_HASH>"}`.
Constructor words: `node tools/swarm_constructor_args.mjs docs/oracle-v37/oracle-config.json binding.json`
(twelve static words).

Objective:

> BLACKOUT SwarmDesk bootstrap on Robinhood Chain (4663). Deploy exactly one contract, `SwarmDesk`, with the twelve static constructor words below, produced by `tools/swarm_constructor_args.mjs` from `docs/oracle-v37/oracle-config.json` and the binding file (factory 0x9c9d2fcb75c2c132c0ac0c42df3819a42347265e, registry/params launch 0 until bind, heartbeat 200 bps, cap 1e18, gameConfigHash <GAME_CONFIG_HASH>): <TWELVE WORDS>. SwarmDesk is the swarm role of the game: it acts only on IMD oracle answers signed by attester 0x5598aa9146215bc13eb26f2c692ad1461fd32982 for its own EIP-712 domain, within hard-coded bounds. It binds once, permissionlessly, to the game registry proven through the ProjectFactory (see docs/m2-trust-assumption.md). The constructor makes no external call. Record and return the deployed address. <COMMON PARAGRAPH>

Check: `cast call <DESK> "registry()(address)"` = `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`;
`cast call <DESK> "bindingConfig()"` decodes to factory `0x9c9d…265e`, heartbeatBps 200, cap 1e18,
`gameConfigHash` = `<GAME_CONFIG_HASH>`; `oracleConfig()` matches `oracle-config.json`.

### M2. EndowmentEscrow (paid, `evm_contracts`, 1 contract)

Inputs: `<DESK>`.

Objective:

> BLACKOUT EndowmentEscrow on Robinhood Chain (4663). Deploy exactly one contract, `EndowmentEscrow`, constructor (0x9c9d2fcb75c2c132c0ac0c42df3819a42347265e = IMD ProjectFactory, 0xf52bbe066b7ad2d28c2195d066ea08dcbca88406 = the ProjectFactory's launch registry used for isRecorded proofs, <DESK> = the BLACKOUT SwarmDesk from M1). It becomes the remainderTo of the BLACKOUT token launch and holds the 20% endowment. Its only exit is `forward`: once, the whole token balance to the RewardPool of the registry the SwarmDesk bound to, proven on chain (pinned creation code + predictContract + isRecorded). It can never pay a wallet. The constructor makes no external call. Record and return the address. <COMMON PARAGRAPH>

Check: `factory()` = `0x9c9d…265e`, `records()` = `0xf52b…8406`, `desk()` = `<DESK>`, `forwarded()` = false.

### M3. Token launch (paid, `launch.open`, `onchain: "univ4_hook"`)

Inputs: `<ESCROW>`, `<DESK>`, `GAME_CONFIG_HASH`, paying wallet.

Request fields (research 4e478378 correction): `onchain: "univ4_hook"`, `chainId: 4663`, `pairWith: "eth"`,
`economics: {"poolBps": 7000, "remainderTo": "<ESCROW>"}`. **No `owner`** (the hook and the game have none)
and **no `initialMarketCapWei`** (only `custom_token` takes it; the ETH-pair opening cap is platform policy,
10 ETH on 4663). The swarm 10% is automatic.

Objective:

> BLACKOUT token launch on Robinhood Chain (4663): onchain univ4_hook, pairWith eth, platform pool fee 12500 (1.25%: 1% to the paying wallet via LaunchFactory.claimFees, 0.25% to the IMD network), economics poolBps 7000 and remainderTo <ESCROW> (the BLACKOUT EndowmentEscrow; the 20% endowment reaches the game RewardPool only through it). Hook: `V4Market` from the accepted BLACKOUT v3.12 commit (solc 0.8.26, optimizer 200, cancun, viaIR false, bytecode_hash none), constructor ($poolManager, $token, 12500, 60, $factory, 0x9c9d2fcb75c2c132c0ac0c42df3819a42347265e, <DESK>, <GAME_CONFIG_HASH>). The hook has no owner; after the stepped 30-minute launch tax it adds exactly 1% to game rewards on every swap plus the progressive sell surcharge. Paying wallet 0x6d51cBE774aeAe4dd40bCA2560E9bc2695A0d007. Record the token, hook and launch number. https://x.com/IMDBlackout · https://playblackout.xyz

Check: `cast call <TOKEN> "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" <ESCROW>` ≥ 200,000,000e18 (the 20% plus any pool
dust the factory did not seed; the fork showed +0.056%); the pool key is `(ETH 0x0, TOKEN, 12500, 60, HOOK)`;
`<HOOK>.launcher()` = LaunchFactory, `poolFee()` = 12500, `desk()` = `<DESK>`, `gameConfigHash()` =
`<GAME_CONFIG_HASH>`, `initializedAt()` ≠ 0; record `<TOKEN>`, `<HOOK>`, `<N_T>`.

### M4. Job A (paid, `evm_contracts`, 8 contracts)

Inputs: `<DESK>`, `<TOKEN>`, `<HOOK>`, `<STARTER_ROOT>`, `<FREE_ROOT>`, `<SNAPSHOT_BLOCK>`. The roots are first
revealed here. Read [docs/m2-trust-assumption.md](docs/m2-trust-assumption.md) before submitting. M5 must
follow the moment this job is recorded. Same-launch references use the manifest's **named** form
`$contract:Params` / `$contract:GameRegistry` (research 4e478378), not the index form `$contract[n]`. If the manifest refuses them, split: Params alone
first, then put its recorded address into GameRegistry.

Objective:

> BLACKOUT job A on Robinhood Chain (4663): eight contracts in this order. [0] Params(<DESK>, 200, 1000000000000000000); [1] GameRegistry(<TOKEN>, $contract:Params, <HOOK>, <STARTER_ROOT>, <FREE_ROOT>, <SNAPSHOT_BLOCK>, 200000000000000000000000000, 0x9c9d2fcb75c2c132c0ac0c42df3819a42347265e); [2] RewardPool($contract:GameRegistry); [3] FarmRewards($contract:GameRegistry); [4] FarmCore($contract:GameRegistry); [5] FarmItems($contract:GameRegistry); [6] PackSale($contract:GameRegistry); [7] StarterClaim($contract:GameRegistry). <TOKEN> and <HOOK> are the BLACKOUT token launch, <DESK> the SwarmDesk. The modules are registered permissionlessly after deployment against pinned creation-code hashes. No constructor makes an external call. Record every address with its index and the launch number. The SwarmDesk binds to this registry right after deployment; see docs/m2-trust-assumption.md for the twin front-run trust assumption. <COMMON PARAGRAPH>

Check: `GameRegistry.params()` = Params, `token()` = `<TOKEN>`, `market()` = `<HOOK>`,
`Params.swarmWallet()` = `<DESK>`; attested creation-code hashes equal `SwarmCode.REGISTRY_LAUNCH`,
`SwarmCode.PARAMS_LAUNCH` and `ModuleCode.launchHash(0..5)`. Record `<N_A>`, `<REGISTRY>`, indices.

### M5. Desk.bind — immediately after M4 (permissionless)

`SwarmDesk.bind(<REGISTRY>, registryCode, paramsCode, <N_A>, 1, <N_A>, 0)` with the `out-launch` creation
codes (`node keeper/keeper.mjs wire --wiring wiring.json --step bind-desk`).

Check: `cast call <DESK> "registry()(address)"` = `<REGISTRY>`. If it is anything else, **stop**: the Desk was
captured by a twin; do not forward the endowment, publish nothing, and escalate to the requester.

### M6. Register job A modules (permissionless)

`GameRegistry.register(role, <N_A>, index, creationCode)` for roles 0–5 (`--step register`).
Check: `GameRegistry.module(r)` for r = 0..5 equals the job A addresses.

### M7. Job B (paid, `evm_contracts`, 8 contracts; may be a `workflow.open` chained with the site job)

Objective:

> BLACKOUT job B on Robinhood Chain (4663): eight contracts, each with the single constructor argument <REGISTRY> (the job A GameRegistry, already bound by SwarmDesk <DESK>): [0] FeeRouter; [1] GridOperator; [2] Season; [3] FarmEngine; [4] Economy; [5] Enhancement; [6] Civic; [7] Billboards. They are registered permissionlessly as roles 6–13 against pinned creation-code hashes; the hook then binds the FeeRouter. No constructor makes an external call. Record every address with its index and the launch number. <COMMON PARAGRAPH>

Then `register` roles 6–13 with `<N_B>`. Check: `GameRegistry.module(r)` for r = 6..13 equals the job B
addresses and the attested hashes equal `ModuleCode.launchHash(6..13)`.

### M8. bindFeeRouter (permissionless)

`V4Market.bindFeeRouter(<FEE_ROUTER>, <N_A>, 1)` (`--step bind-router`).
Check: `<HOOK>.fees()` = `<FEE_ROUTER>`, `<HOOK>.params()` = Params; `flushFees()` simulates without
`NotConfigured`.

### M9. escrow.forward (permissionless)

Precondition: `Desk.registry()` = `<REGISTRY>` (M5 check repeated). Call
`EndowmentEscrow.forward(<REGISTRY>, <N_A>, 1, registryCode, <N_A>, 2, poolCode)` (`--step forward`).
Check: `forwarded()` = true, `TOKEN.balanceOf(ESCROW)` = 0, `TOKEN.balanceOf(RewardPool)` ≥ 200,000,000e18,
`Forwarded` event names the registry and the pool.

### M10. fundEndowment (permissionless)

`RewardPool.fundEndowment()` (`--step fund`).
Check: `endowed()` = true, `lockedEndowment()` = 200,000,000e18 at funding and decreasing linearly over the
drip period.

### M11. Oracle schedules (paid on Ethereum, `schedule.create`)

Inputs: `<DESK>`. Bodies: `node tools/make_oracle_bodies.mjs <DESK>` writes
`docs/oracle-v37/event-schedule.json` (cron `5 */6 * * *` UTC, 4 per day, 28 runs) and
`regulator-schedule.json` (cron `5 0 * * 4` UTC, weekly, 4 runs). Since v3.10 they carry
`consumer {chainId: 4663, verifyingContract: <DESK>}` and **no** `deliver` (schedules refuse it). Preflight
both with the free schedule check first.

Objective (one request per schedule; paste the generated JSON as the input):

> BLACKOUT oracle schedule (Ethereum payment, consumer SwarmDesk <DESK> on Robinhood Chain 4663). Create the schedule exactly as in the attached `schedule.create` body generated by `tools/make_oracle_bodies.mjs` from the accepted BLACKOUT v3.12 commit: committed question body byte-for-byte (questionHash <QUESTION_HASH> from docs/oracle-v37/oracle-config.json), consumer {chainId 4663, verifyingContract <DESK>}, no deliver, cadence <CRON> UTC, <RUNS> runs. Answers are relayed permissionlessly to SwarmDesk.submit. https://x.com/IMDBlackout

Check: `GET /schedules/<id>` shows status active and the runs; after the first run,
`GET /oracle/requests/<run>/attestation` has `verifyingContract` = `<DESK>`, chainId 4663 and the pinned
question hash. Put the ids in `SCHEDULE_EVENT` / `SCHEDULE_REGULATOR`. Cost: 14.5 IMD/week at 0.5 IMD per run.

### M12. Keeper start (requester's `<KEEPER_WALLET>`) — within the first hour after M3

The first `FarmRewards.advanceEpoch()` is allowed from the pool initialization on and **must land before
packs open at launch + 1h**: pack sales record into the live epoch and revert `TooEarly` until epoch 1 exists
(fork rehearsal). Fill `/etc/blackout/keeper.env` from `keeper/keeper.env.example` (RPC, `REGISTRY`, `KEEPER_KEY`,
`SCHEDULE_EVENT`, `SCHEDULE_REGULATOR`, `LAUNCH_FACTORY`, `TOKEN_LAUNCH=<N_T>`), fund the wallet with gas
ETH, `systemctl enable --now blackout-keeper`.
Check: `node keeper/keeper.mjs status` shows the registry, the next epoch, the schedules; after the first
schedule run `SwarmDesk.lastAnswer(0)` shows the relayed answer and the next GridOperator plan is set; the
following `advanceEpoch` calls land at `FarmRewards.epochEnd()`.

### M13. LaunchFactory.claimFees (permissionless, recurring)

`LaunchFactory.claimFees(<N_T>)` (keeper every 6 h, or `--step claim-fees`).
Check: the paying wallet's ETH increases by about 1% of swap volume since the last claim (fork: 0.0198 ETH after
a 2 ETH buy); the IMD network receives 0.25%.

## 4. What is never paused or owned

Claims, withdrawals, sync, settlement, epochs, entropy, repairs, locks/unlocks, buybacks, season finalize,
`Desk.bind`, `bindFeeRouter`, `EndowmentEscrow.forward` and `fundEndowment` have no pause path. The only
pause (new packs incl. the ETH zap and black-market buys) comes from an attested oracle answer, lasts at most
72 hours and needs 72 live hours between pauses. If oracle answers stop, epochs keep running on the fallback
event table and the current Params. Pack profile Balanced, roots, snapshot block and endowment are fixed at
deploy.
